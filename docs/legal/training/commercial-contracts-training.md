## Introduction
Commercial Contracts can seem like a topic that is fraught with danger, but as long as you are sensible, there is nothing to be worried about.  This is a simple guide that tells you the things to look out for when discussing commercial contracts with customers.  If you're ever in any doubt, contact the Nimble Legal Team for some friendly advice.

## Key Principles:
* Before a proposal is issued to a customer, sign-post to the customer that we assume Nimble’s standard MSA and SOW will apply.  Explain that the commercial proposition is based on Nimble’s terms applying. 
* If the customer insists that their terms are used, then we need to see these as soon as possible (ideally before we submit our proposal) so any red flags can be raised.
* Legal to review statements of work prior to issuing to a customer.

## Nimble Contractual Documents
* NDA – (Non-Disclosure Agreement) Signed at the start of a discussion with a customer. These can be mutual or one way.  If Nimble is disclosing confidential information, then the agreement must be mutual.  We have a new template. More on NDAs later.
* MSA – (Master Services Agreement) Framework agreement under which SOWs can then be entered into.  If there is no signed MSA then there are no terms which can apply to a SOW. 
* SOW – (Statement of Work) Signed in relation to a particular project or piece of work.  These must be signed to take effect.   There must be a “live” SOW in place – we cannot work at risk because (1) there is a risk we won’t receive payment and (2) there are no contractual terms in place i.e., no cap on liability and none of our usual protections. 

## Why Customers should use Nimble's MSA
* Our MSA is fit for purpose - it's an agile document enabling us to work on a T and M or a fixed price basis.
* Our MSA is an overarching agreement under which separate SOWs can be called off - no need for complex negotiation every time we work with a customer.
* The limitations (caps) on liability are fair.
* The MSA contains terms on important principles such as data protection (relevant if we are processing personal data as a processor of the customer), intellectual property (IP in the work is assigned to the customer) and on confidentiality  - so gives comfort to the customer.
* It's a succinct document (only 15 pages) so it’s easy to read and understand.
* If the customer can sign our terms, then we can begin work straight away - no protracted negotiation.
* If the customer has things that they particularly want to change in the MSA, then we can look to do that - the terms are not set in stone and there is room for negotiation.  

# Contractual Red Flags
* Ideally, Nimble’s standard MSA should be used.  However, this is not always possible.
* If we are using a customer’s terms, then the following are important issues to consider:
* Limitation on liability
* Warranty
* Indemnity clauses
* Intellectual Property
* Delivery
* Fitness for purpose obligations

## Limitation of Liability
* Liability under contracts for direct  losses should always be capped (or limited), for example at the value of the relevant SOW.
* Direct losses are usually the customer’s costs involved in achieving proper performance of the contract (by Nimble or a third party). 
* Liability for indirect and consequential losses should be be excluded.  We must also specifically exclude loss of profit. 
* Indirect and consequential losses includes all costs and losses which are not direct losses, for example loss of production or loss of goodwill.
* If there is no limitation of liability clause then our liability under the contract is unlimited (i.e. we can be sued for an unlimited amount). 

## Warranty
* We should try to resist giving a warranty at all.  If we provide a warranty and an issue occurs, then we could be asked to rectify the defect free of charge. 
* If we must give a warranty, then we need to set a time limit on the warranty we give on the services we supply, usually no more than 3 months from delivery.  
* We should try to list specific exclusions (i.e. what we are NOT warranting), for example misuse or defects in the customer’s own design.

## Indemnity Clauses
* Any indemnities in the contract (i.e. clauses beginning with or containing “the Supplier indemnifies the Customer for…”) should be deleted. 
* An indemnity means that the customer does not have to mitigate its losses (i.e. reduce its losses as far as possible). 
* An indemnity means that the customer does not need to substantiate its losses either (i.e. prove its losses).
* One common exception:
    * We may be prepared to give an indemnity to cover the customer in case our design infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.  
    * If we do agree to give an indemnity, then we should make sure that it is subject to the limitation of liability. 

## Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
* We require that our background IPR be protected.  This is the IPR Nimble owns prior to the contract being entered into.  We may want to give the customer a licence to our background IPR however, but only to enable the use of the services which are the subject of the contract. 
* Usually, we agree that any IPR brought into existence after the formation of the contract and as a result of carrying out the work (sometimes called “arising IPR”) belongs to the customer as opposed to Nimble, however it’s worth considering this position for every contract in case there’s something we would want to retain.  
* Nimble may want to ensure that it has been given a licence by the customer to use the customer’s IPR in the delivery of the services depending on the nature of what is being supplied by Nimble.  

## Delivery 
* We work on an agile basis therefore we need to state that “delivery dates are estimates only and time shall not be of the essence”. 
* However – if the customer insists on delivery dates, then we need to consider if the delivery dates stated in the contract are realistic?  
* Are payments under the contract tied to delivery dates/milestones?  If so, we really need to consider if the milestones are realistic and the implications of not reaching them.  
* Is there provision for an extension of time/claim for loss and expense/relief from the obligations under the contract if something outside our control happens causing delivery to be delayed?

## Fitness for Purpose
* We should try to delete any clauses which state that the services or deliverables must be “fit for purpose” or “fit for the purpose for which they are intended”.  
* It may be that Nimble has not been fully informed of the intended purpose of the services/deliverables therefore cannot be placed under an obligation to ensure that the services/deliverables are fit for that purpose.  
* We could instead offer to include wording that the services/deliverables will comply with a specification which is agreed in writing by both parties.  This means that the standard we have to attain is clearly set out.  This offers sufficient protection to the customer so should be acceptable.

## SoWs - Drafting Point to Consider
* Check the parties.  Do the parties match those in the MSA?  If not, does the MSA cover customer and supplier affiliates?
* Check the SOW document is referenced/numbered properly so we can easily refer to it
* Check the SOW refers to the correct overarching MSA and the MSA is referred to properly (i.e., the MSA between Nimble Limited and [Customer] dated [date])
* Double check the rates, the number of days and the total fees.  Is VAT expressed to be excluded? 
* Language used - Don’t over commit, use wording such as “aim for” “assist with”.  
* Fixed price – Are we sure we can meet the objectives within the timeframe and within the fixed cost?  
* Agile wording: The following can be useful: 
    “The Services being provided by the Supplier under this SOW shall follow an agile development framework with all Services being provided on a [time and materials/fixed price] basis as set out in the table above.  The parties acknowledge that any mutually agreed timeframes for the provision of the Services and/or the production of Deliverables may be subject to change at any time as a result of variables including but not limited to i) Customer changing its priorities as regards Deliverables to be produced or ii) any third party dependencies outside of the control of the Supplier
* How long is the term of the SOW? If the term is more than 12 months, do we have a mechanism for increasing our rates?  
* Are payments tied to milestones or acceptance?  Ideally, try and avoid this where possible.
* Are there any Customer Responsibilities?  - Have we captured all of these?  Is the language tight enough? 
* Are there any Assumptions – Have we captured all these?  Is the language tight enough?
* Are we processing any personal data?  If so, have we added in the particulars of the processing? i.e., the nature and purpose of the processing, the duration of the processing, the types of personal data and the types of data subject 
* Some examples of where we could do better:
* Repetition
* Overuse of definitions
* Underuse of definitions
* Leaving language vague hoping it’ll be ok 
* Convoluted language
* Lack of conciseness
* Remember: Stand back, read with a clear head – can we actually deliver what we’re being asked to deliver?  Does the SOW definitely cover: what we’re doing and when, how, with which people, for how much and when we will be paid?
  

## NDA's - Key Points
* If possible, use Nimble’s standard mutual non-disclosure agreement.
* Check the parties: Are they actually the parties swapping the information?
* Is the agreement one-way or mutual?  If an agreement is one-way, what is the discloser getting in return? You may need to turn the agreement into a ‘deed’ with special signature requirements to ensure there is adequate “consideration” (this is required in order to form a contract).  
* Check the definition of ‘confidential information’. Do you want the agreement to apply only to information which is marked as confidential, or generally to all information which is confidential in nature?
* Are there effective use restrictions as well as non-disclosure requirements? It is necessary to stop recipients of confidential information from disclosing it to others, but equally important to stop them from using it themselves for anything other than expressly authorised purposes.   
* How long do the restrictions within the NDA last?  The agreement may last for a limited period, but the restrictions should continue indefinitely (or at least until the information is no longer confidential in nature and this is not caused by the recipient).  
* Which law governs the agreement, and which country will be judging it?  Interpretation and enforcement of ‘foreign’ law will always be more expensive, and you may not necessarily know what you’ve agreed. 
* Any indemnities within the NDA should be deleted. 
* Check the signatories.  It is vital that each signatory has the necessary authority to bind their company.  You may need two authorised signatories. 
* Remember the language of NDAs MUST be very clear and unambiguous if the agreement is to be enforceable.
* MOST IMPORTANTLY remember that an NDA is not a magic wand.  Always assess the sensitivity and value of any information you propose to disclose. ONLY disclose what is absolutely necessary, to specified recipients, and, if appropriate, put in place additional practical protections e.g. clearly marking information as “CONFIDENTIAL”.
