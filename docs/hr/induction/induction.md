# Induction Essentials

##  Welcome!

Well hello there! It's great that you've decided to join the Robiquity Team and help us do great things for our customers, and hopefully make Robiquity an even better place to be.  You've probably had your formal induction by now, met a whole host of interesting people and filled in lots of essential paperwork.   

We know that the first couple of days can be a bit of a blur and its hard to keep track of everything you've been told, so we've provided a handy link to the Technology/Delivery induction slides you'll have seen on your first day.

These slides don't cover *everything* you need to know, but they might jog your memory from time to time.  Aside from these reading these slides and browsing the rest of the Robiquity Knowledge Base, don't be afraid to give a colleague a nudge and ask them if they can help with any questions you might have. We're a pretty friendly bunch and even if the first person you ask can't help, they'll know someone who can.
