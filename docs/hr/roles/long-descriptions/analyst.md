# Discovery Analyst & Discovery Lead
## Job Description 

## Summary
Discovery Analysts are key to Robiquity understanding the challenges our customers face and how we can best deliver effective solutions to meet those challenges. Discovery Analysts make sure we solve the right problem, implement the right solution, and put customers on the right strategic path. They play a pivotal role in shaping the direction of intelligent automation initiatives, ensuring they align with the client's overarching strategic business objectives and provide a competitive advantage in the market.

Discovery Analysts are typically multi-talented individuals that have a wide range of skills, tools, and techniques at their disposal. The role involves a unique mix of investigatory, analysis, service and process design, people, technical and strategic thinking skills which are all brought together in a careful mix.

It takes experience to get this mix right, so this role is usually carried out by people who are at the Consultant level or above. 

Discovery Leads use their more extensive experience to advise customers on company level strategic initiatives, answering questions such as “What should I aim to achieve?”, “What is the best way to achieve that?” and “Where should we start?”

*  A proven ability to use that insight to create a roadmap of connected business initiatives that will deliver long term strategic benefit to customers.

*  A solid understanding of market trends in a range of industry verticals, with the ability to use research and analysis to drive pragmatic innovation and thought leadership for Robiquity and our customers.
