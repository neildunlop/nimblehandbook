## Responsibilities
### Designing and Delivering Exceptional Solutions
As one of the most technically knowledgeable people in the company, you will adopt a comprehensive approach to automation solution design, identifying the right technologies and architectural approaches to create scalable, resilient, and high performing solutions that meet customer needs. 

You’ll work as part of a team to curate a portfolio of ‘best of breed’ Robiquity solutions that can be adapted and reused to quickly meet customer challenges across a range of industries and use cases and support colleagues in their adoption.

You’ll collaborate with colleagues and client technology stakeholders to create modern, effective, and well documented solutions that meet both functional and non-functional requirements which adhere to robust data management and security policies.

Finally, you’ll use your extensive knowledge to help delivery teams bring your solutions to life, overcoming implementation and integration challenges to turn a sound design into a smoothly running production system.
### New Engagements – Shaping & Starting Engagements
You will often be asked to help in shaping and promoting our service propositions to new customers. You will collaborate with Robiquity Client Partners and the Sales team to effectively position our solutions to address client needs and win new engagements. 
You will work to build strong relationships with senior client stakeholders, aiming to become a trusted advisor, helping them to integrate automation and associated solutions into their technology strategy.
For critical engagements, you will join the delivery team in a hands-on, leadership capacity to make sure they start things the right way, understand the solution they are implementing and do things the Robiquity way. You will work to empower the team so that they no longer need your day to day engagement, and when the time is right, you will step away, always available to return and support the team if needed.
### Existing Accounts – Expert Capability
For our engagements that are already up and running we need to ensure that we continue to do a good job for our customers, with early warning of any emerging issues. You will work with other Solution Architects and Practice Leads to develop and use a set of structured questions that act as prompts to identify where the team could most use some support. 

You will check with all engagements every 2-4 weeks, and it will be down to you to provide appropriate support to help resolve any issues they identify. This will often mean you use your own hands-on skill to fix serious issues, it may mean you coach the team to raise their skill level so they can resolve the issue themselves, or it may mean you identify other people from across the business with the right skills who can help. 

You will work with other Solution Architects and Practice Leads to ensure that every engagement across Robiquity is supported and you will keep the board, other Solution Architects and Practice Leads informed of your findings and any areas you’re helping with.
You will work with Client Partners, Tech Leads and Delivery Leads in key engagements to identify opportunities for clients to make more extensive use of automation solutions. Together you’ll proactively build and deliver proposals that broaden the scope of our work and unlock more benefits for our customers.
### Consulting
Like most roles at Robiquity you’re a consultant and a technologist and will work with clients to design, build, and run solutions that deliver the results they need. You’ll bolster our struggling engagements and where necessary, work directly on our most challenging engagements and billing your time will be a standard part of your role. 
### Technical Quality
You will play a key role in ensuring we have technically excellent solutions. You’ll need to be able to assess the technical quality of a solution and work with teams to improve quality where necessary, not only knowing what to do to make things better, but how to do it. 
You will work with the CTO, the Technology Operations Director, Practice Leads and other senior colleagues to devise and implement guidelines against which we assess engineering quality.
### Technology Curation
The technology landscape is always changing. New tools, techniques and solutions are brought to market with ever increasing rapidity. You will be responsible for keeping Robiquity at the forefront of technology, identifying, evaluating, and bringing new technologies into the everyday use when they are ready, and not before.

You will remain knowledgeable about modern technology with a broad overview of the entire landscape.  You will know how and when to best apply these technologies. You will educate colleagues on the ‘art of the possible’ and keep them up to speed on how to use emerging technologies in the right way.
### Hiring and Developing the Best
Despite being a technology company, without great people, Robiquity has nothing. Hiring great people and making sure they always have opportunities to learn, develop and grow is key our success. As a technical leader at Robiquity you will play a significant role in making sure we hire the right people with the right skills, behaviours, and aspirations – while maintaining our quality bar. 
You won’t have any direct line management for staff, so you’ll focus on setting direction, showing the art of the possible and keeping people abreast of what is happening across the company and in the wider technology industry.
### Cross Pollination
You will be working in a role that spans multiple clients and will be able to see the detail of what is happening in each engagement. This puts you in a good position to ‘join the dots’ and spread knowledge, best practice and lessons learned between teams and colleagues.
### Supporting Culture
Robiquity has some simple but effective values that help to define and guide our culture. You will be responsible for bringing our culture to life and role modelling our values, making them a core part of how our teams conduct themselves, to help make Robiquity a great place to work. 
### Mentoring
As one of the most senior technologists in the business, it is natural that other team members will aspire to your role and aim to emulate your capabilities. You should work to mentor colleagues to help them grow their capabilities and advance their careers.
### Technology Integration and Managed Services
Solutions only deliver real value when they are stable and secure, reliably running in a production environment. You will ensure that all solutions are designed with the principle of ‘operations from day one’ and address infrastructure, integration, deployment, and operational concerns by design.

You will work with development teams and managed service teams to ensure that all solutions have a well-structured and clearly documented acceptance into service and can be easily and effectively supported and maintained by managed service teams, whether they are Robiquity of client staff. Where things to wrong, you will use your skills and knowledge to support the managed service team and ensure that issues are resolved quickly.
