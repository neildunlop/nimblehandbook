## Responsibilities
### Increased Customer Engagement
As one of the most technically knowledgeable people in the company, you will frequently be called upon to represent Robiquity to new and existing customers.  You will support the sales team in positioning and effectively promoting Robiquity solutions, particularly those involving your vendor partner. You will share your technology and domain expertise to position Robiquity as a trusted and knowledgeable partner.
### New Engagements – Starting Things the Right Way
You will often be the first person to start a customer engagement, but crucially, you will not be there for the long term. Your job is to get new engagements off to a good start by working alongside the long-term Technology Lead in the initial days and weeks to establish solid foundations. When the time is right, you will exit, available to return and support if needed.
### Existing Accounts – Checking In
For our engagements that are already up and running we need to ensure that we continue to do a good job for our customers, with early warning of any emerging issues. You will work with other Practice Leads to develop and use a set of structured questions that act as prompts to identify where the team could most use some support. 
You will check with all engagements that use technology from your practice every 2-4 weeks and it will be down to you to provide appropriate support to help resolve any issues they identify. This may mean you use your own hands-on skill to fix serious issues, it may mean you coach the team to raise their skill level so they can resolve the issue themselves, or it may mean you identify other people from across the business with the right skills who can help. 
You will work with other Practice Leads to ensure that every engagement across Robiquity is supported on their engagement and you will keep board and other Practice Leads informed of your findings and any areas you’re helping with.
### Consulting
Like most roles at Robiquity you’re a consultant and a technologist and will work with clients to build solutions that deliver the results they need. You’ll bolster our struggling engagements and where necessary, work directly on our most challenging engagements and billing your time will be a standard part of your role. In contrast to other consultants at Robiquity, you should aim to make your engagements short, sharp and highly effective rather than taking long term roles that are critical to the success of an engagement.
### Technical Quality
You will be responsible for the technical quality of all client deliverables for your practice. You will also work to support other Practice Leads in ensuring the technical quality of their deliverables. This is not just an assurance role. You’ll need to know the technical quality of all deliverables and be able to influence teams to improve quality where necessary. For example, where a team is perceived to be delivering a solution with too many bugs, you will first need to confirm it is a genuine issue and not just a perception, then understand why it’s happening and then help the team address the root cause of the issue.
You will work with the CTO, the Technology Operations Director, Practice Leads and other senior colleagues to devise and implement guidelines against which we assess engineering quality.
### Technology Curation
The technology landscape is always changing. New tools, techniques and solutions are brought to market with ever increasing rapidity. You will be responsible for keeping Robiquity at the forefront of technology, identifying, evaluating, and bringing new technologies into the everyday use when they are ready, and not before. 
You will remain knowledgeable about modern technology with a broad overview of the entire landscape and a sharp focus on the offerings in your practice.  You will know how and when to best apply these technologies. You will educate colleagues on the ‘art of the possible’ with technologies in your practice and keep them up to speed on how to use emerging technologies in the right way.
### Hiring and Developing the Best
Despite being a technology company, without great people, Robiquity has nothing. Hiring great people and making sure they always have opportunities to learn, develop and grow is key our success. As a technical leader at Robiquity you will play a significant role in making sure we hire the right people with the right skills, behaviours, and aspirations – while maintaining our quality bar. You will also ensure our people are always learning new things and pushing themselves professionally, particularly where they relate to the tools and technologies in your practice. 
You won’t have any direct line management for staff, so you’ll focus on setting direction, showing the art of the possible and keeping people abreast of what is happening across the company and in the wider technology industry.
### Cross Pollination
You will be working in a role that spans multiple clients and will be able to see the detail of what is happening in each engagement. This puts you in a good position to ‘join the dots’ and spread knowledge, best practice and lessons learned between teams and colleagues.
### Supporting Culture
Robiquity has some simple but effective values that help to define and guide our culture. You will be responsible for bringing our culture to life and role modelling our values, making them a core part of how our teams conduct themselves, to help make Robiquity a great place to work. 
### Mentoring
As one of the most senior technologists in the business, it is natural that other team members will aspire to your role and aim to emulate your capabilities. You should work to mentor colleagues to help them grow their capabilities and advance their careers.
### Partner & Community Relationships
A key element of your role is to build a strong, mutually beneficial relationship with our partner vendors, helping us to deliver the right solutions, using the right technologies in a highly effective way for our clients. You’ll build our in-house capability, supporting staff to increase their understand of and skill with technologies from your practice. You will encourage colleagues to obtain appropriate certifications. You’ll increase our standing with partners by contributing to their initiatives, understanding their focus and highlighting stand out uses of their solutions that we’ve developed with our clients.
You’ll also work to build Robiquity’s reputation for being knowledgeable, technically excellent, the partner of choice for our clients and preferred place to work for our potential hires by organising, attending, and contributing to events.
