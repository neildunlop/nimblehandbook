# Developer
## Job Description 

## Summary
Developers are at the heart of what Robiquity does. More of the team identify as developers than any other role and it is one of the broadest and from a skills and experience perspective. The tools, techniques and technologies used to develop Robiquity solutions are always evolving, so pinning down the specifics of the role can be difficult.

Front end, back end, low code, infrastructure, automation, data, analytics, AI, and vendor specific technology - there are many different labels that get attached to the many different flavours of development. We value all these things, but the universal element of this role is a deep understanding of technology. 

Because of this ever-changing landscape it important for developers to be flexible and open to learning languages, technologies, and ways of working that they have not used before.
 
Seniority and progression can be achieved in two ways.  One is by going deeper into specific technologies and becoming increasingly expert. The second by is going wider across multiple technologies. Both require developers to expand their scope, understand more about how technology fits into the bigger business picture, and increase their sphere of influence with more senior colleagues, stakeholder, and industry peers.
