# Applicant Tracking System

**Status:** Not Started

**What:** Applicant Tracking System  
**Why:** We need a consistent way of keeping track of the people that apply for jobs at Nimble and a way to monitor their progress through the recruitment process. Consistent tracking of progress and feedback at each stage of the process will make sure we don't stall good candidates and we make good hiring decisions based on a consistent, fair and transparent process that can be audited.  
**How:** We could buy a commercial tool to do this work, or we could quickly build one for our own purposes that does just enough for now.
