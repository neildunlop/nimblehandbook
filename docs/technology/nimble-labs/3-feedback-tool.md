**What:** In Team Feedback Tool  
**Why:** To help all of our team members improve professionally, we should have a tool that allows team members to provide feedback to one another and rate each other against Nimble Core Attributes outside of the standard review cycle. The purpose of the tool is to allow teammates to share informal, constructive feedback that helps colleagues improve.  
**How:** A power platform app that allows users to score colleagues against Nimble Core attributes and provide positive feedback, as well as areas for improvement.  Could also be expanded to track scores and feedback over time.
