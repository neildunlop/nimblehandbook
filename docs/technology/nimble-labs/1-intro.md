# Nimble Labs

## Introduction
From time to time, you may find yourself not working on a billable client enagagement. Don't worry, this isn't the end of the world. You can use this non-billable time (also known as 'bench' time) to investigate new technologies and techniques to build your skills. 

We always have a list of great ideas we'd love to bring to life, if only we had the time. These ideas can take many forms like investigating new technologies, writing up things we already know so that we can share them with colleagues, creating new marketing collateral that we can use to engage customers or building useful internal tools that will make all our lives easier, the list is probably endless. We collect all these ideas into Nimble Labs where we are free to experiment without the expectation of a production grade outcome from our efforts.

## What's the point?
The main point of Nimble Labs is to have a space where people can share, investigate and experiment. The objective is that we learn from our experiments. Labs projects don't always have to have a tangible outcome, but you should always share what you've learned in the form of a write up. Sometimes the best progress you can make is to move things forward a little for the next person to pick up.  If you do create something that we can all learn from, share and potentially use, thats great.

## When can I work on a Labs Project?
Anyone can work on a bench project whenever they like, but it should never be at the expense of client work. Additionally, while it might be cool and exciting to work on a new project in your own time, we'd strongly encourage everyone to consider their work/life balance. All work and no play, no matter how interesting the project, isn't a good thing in the long run.

## How are Labs Projects structured and run?
Every Nimble Labs project has a Knowledge Base page associated with it so that everyone knows what the project is, what its objectives, what work has been done so far and where to find it. Every project should ideally have an Azure DevOps repository associated with it, which also has an agile board associated with it.  We like to run labs projects using an agile approach because it suits the adhoc nature of the work well. Agile allows us to take small slices of work, define them well, size them up, work on them, test them and release them in small chunks. In short, a labs project should be run like a good open source project.

## How do I work on a Labs Project?
Every Labs project will have a nominated project lead who may not work on the project full time but their job is to coordinate the work, give people who want to work on the project an introduction and make sure that the work heads in the right direction with the right degree of quality. 

## I have an idea for a Labs Project
If you have an idea for a Labs project that you don't see here, give Neil Dunlop, Anthony de Broise, a Practice Lead (Ed Zwarra, Dan Reeves, Callum Croft, Stuart Baxter, Chris Ramsden or Laurie Bowden), or a Solution Architect (Fred Grover, Nick Baumer) a nudge and they'll help you move things forward.
