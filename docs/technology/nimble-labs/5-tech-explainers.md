A tech explainer is a 1-3 page document that is aimed at a tech literate, but not expert, business stakeholder. The purpose of the document is to provide an example of a piece of technical functionality in action (potentially with an interactive demo), explain what it can be used for in a business context, provide example industry uses, and explain what is needed to apply it to business use.
