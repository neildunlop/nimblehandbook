# Feedback Wrap
The Feedback Wrap is a structured approach for constructing helpful, effective feedback.  Taken from an Agile Leadership approach called Management 3.0, it is a technique that maximises the chance of feedback having the best outcome for both the person giving the feedback and the person receiving the feedback. In short, the Feedback Wrap helps you give better feedback.

##  When should I use the Feedback Wrap?
The Feedback Wrap can be used in almost any situation where you need to set or manage expectations, or you want to share how someone’s actions have impacted you. Expectation management is particularly crucial in newly formed relationships. If people don’t know what your expectations are for their performance or behaviour, and you never let them know when they don’t meet those expectations (or even if they exceed your expectations), they never get a chance to course correct. 

## How does the Feedback Wrap work?
Feedback should have real value for the recipient and achieves the intended aim of the person giving the feedback. The Feedback Wrap technique prompts you to carefully consider what you hope to achieve by delivering feedback and how you should deliver that feedback so that it lands effectively.  

The Feedback Wrap is a simple template for structuring and organising what you are trying to say that has five key steps:

### 1.	Describe your context
Start by offering some background to set the scene, provide some context and increase the other persons understanding and appreciation of your situation.

> “During the customer showcase today, when you were demonstrating the new automation features…”

### 2.	List your observations
The next step is to describe the details of what you are giving feedback on and make them focussed on behaviours and actions.

> “I noticed you said, ‘it works well when I run them, I can’t be held responsible for the testers missing things and the production environments being inconsistent’…”

### 3.	Express your feelings
Describe how their actions made you feel to make the feedback more powerful and help the feedback recipient reflect on the effect of their actions on others, rather than focussing on themselves.

> “This made me feel very uncomfortable on behalf of the team and I’m worried that it makes us look unprofessional and defensive in front of our customers.”

### 4.	Explain the value
Explain what is important to you and why. This is the valuable part of the feedback. This element explains what you care about.

> “We work as a team, in collaboration with each other and our customers’ staff to solve problems and deliver value together. We always want others to see that. I don’t think the way you expressed yourself would create that impression.”

### 5.	Offer some suggestions
Provide the recipient with some suggestions to help them improve, rather than just dumping a complain on them and leaving them to figure out how to do things better in the future. You could also ask a question to prompt them for suggestions on how they think they could do things differently.

> “I’ll happily help you to work on your communication techniques when dealing with senior stakeholders.  I can share a way of phrasing things that gets your point across without upsetting people. As a team, we can look at how we improve our ways of working so that development and testing are more joined up and we don’t miss things in the future.”

## How should I use Feedback Wrap?
One of the biggest benefits of the Feedback Wrap is that it helps you to take some time to organise your thoughts and think about what you want to say, instead of letting your emotions loose. Following all the steps in the process and writing down your answers to each of the prompts ensures that you deliver meaningful and well-rounded feedback.
If you’re going to deliver the feedback in person (and you probably should!) then don’t deliver it as a speech. Use your notes from the Feedback Wrap process to structure a two-way conversation, taking care to listen to what the other person is saying.

If you must deliver your feedback in a written form, you should aim to follow the structure subtly and avoid explicit, broken out steps. Take extra time to review your language and phrasing, its much easier to misinterpret the intention of written feedback.  Where possible, get a trusted peer to review what you write before you send it.

## Why is Feedback important?
Feedback is a vital process for helping people to grow and develop. It helps us learn about and reflect on things that we otherwise may not have know we were doing. Creating good, constructive feedback is hard and many people struggle to give and receive feedback. By putting a focus on giving effective feedback we can build a culture where honest feedback is shared frequently and helps individuals, teams and the company get better.

## What makes good feedback?
There is a difference between appreciation and feedback, and everyone needs both. Appreciation is recognising that people do things that make a positive difference. There is probably no way you can overdo appreciation – nobody has ever had worse performance because they were appreciated!

Feedback is a bit trickier. Feedback is often too high level and vague, whether is positive (“You did a great job on that project, you were a key part of the team!”) or negative (“You’re not really pulling your weight and the rest of the team is suffering as a result!”).  For feedback to be effective, it needs to be something the receiver can act upon. Anything that we can do to make feedback more specific and actionable increases the odds of the feedback being useful and well received.
The characteristics of good feedback are:

### Specific
The more specific the feedback, the higher the chance that the recipient will be able to understand it and turn it into something they can learn from and action. Keeping feedback, small, specific and focussed makes it easier for the recipient to know what you want them to change.  For example feedback like, “You’re lazy”  is hard for someone to act upon, whereas “I expect someone of your seniority to be more proactive. If nobody tells you what to do, look at the backlog and take the next highest priority item to work on. If you’re stuck, ask for help to get it resolved.”

### Timely
Give feedback as close to the event as possible. As time passes, the specifics of the situation will be forgotten by all involved. Ideally feedback should be given as soon as possible, while considering whether its an appropriate time and place – and whether the recipient is in the right frame of mind to receive feedback.

### Frequent
For feedback to be useful as a tool for reflection and self-improvement it should be an ongoing process and not a one-off event. Aim to build a culture where feedback is a normal part of work and not something exceptional and unusual. Using feedback frequently also helps to keep it small and specific and not give them too many things to work on. Having two or three things to be thinking about works well for most people.

### Given to help the person grow and improve
Think carefully about why you are giving feedback before you do it. Are you giving feedback to try and help the recipient improve or just to get something off your chest and make you feel better? If it’s the latter, think about whether its really going to be beneficial. It’s highly likely to have the opposite effect.

If you’re receiving feedback, ask yourself the same question. Is the person delivering the feedback doing it to try and help you improve? Even if the feedback is uncomfortable, it is worth taking the feedback and giving it some thought. Nobody likes to hear that they’ve not met another person’s expectations – but it could be worse, they could have never told you!

Feedback is just data. It requires further examination before you take it on-board and make changes. If the feedback is genuinely given to try and help you improve, embrace it and work on it.  If feedback is given just to make the giver feel better, you can always choose to ignore it and move on – don’t let it get you down.  

### Focussed around the behaviour, not the person
Its natural for us to be closed to receiving feedback, even if its constructive. Its just our natural human defence mechanisms kicking in. There is little that the person receiving the feedback can do in that moment and they feel especially vulnerable.  If you’re the person delivering the feedback, think very carefully about how you make it constructive and not critical, and focussed on the action or the behaviour, NOT the person.  For example:

> “You’re always late to standup! You’re laziness is getting to me!” is very personal and will not elicit a positive response from the receiver.

If we focus the feedback in a different way, it is likely to be better received:  “I’ve noticed you’ve arrived late to standup all this week.  If everyone isn’t there it means that we are missing vital information as a group and we have to repeat conversation. Is there anything I can do to help make it easier for you to be at standup?”

Its not always guaranteed to work but it increases the odds of the feedback being received in an open and positive way.

### Ask First
Before giving someone feedback, ask them if they’d like to receive feedback. Most of the time the answer will be yes, and it will help them get into an open frame of mind. Asking also gives them the opportunity to delay the feedback, particularly if they are in the middle of something else and wouldn’t be particularly receptive at that moment. “Would you be open to some feedback?” is usually all you need to ask.	

### Taken as a gift
It sounds incredibly cheesy but try and take feedback as a gift and be grateful that someone has taken the time to think specifically about you. It can be very hard to form and deliver feedback to a colleague – and not to mention it can take a lot of guts! Even if you don’t agree with the feedback, or feel it could have been delivered better, its worth acknowledging the feedback and may help you to see feedback in a positive light.
