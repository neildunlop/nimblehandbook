# Value Mapping
Value mapping is an approach that connects our services and activities to a successful business outcome, which in turn links that a key value driver for the customer.  Ideally, this connection will be very clear and quantifiable.  

## The Process
Start with a key stakeholder or group of key similar stakeholders in mind (repeat for each stakeholder):  
1. What is the service/engagement/project they are undertaking? Name it.
2. Who are the stakeholders? Make a note of the function that uses it and the role of the most senior individual involved.  
3. What is THEIR use case? This may be different from the service identified in step (1) and more specific.  
4. What business outcome are they trying to achieve?  
5. Is it quantifiable? If so, what quantified outcomes are being targeted vs achieved?  
6. Connect it to one of the 4 Value Drivers   
    a. Make Money
    b. Save Money
    c. Reduce Risk
    d. Drive Strategy
