# Delivery Quality 

Delivering great solutions is what our customers engage us for, what gets us all paid and it's the most interesting part of what we do. We need to make sure we continue to do a great job for our customers.  

To do a great job for our customers we need to make sure that we know what 'good' looks like, everyone knows how to 'do good' and we have early warning of where things aren’t ‘good’.  

Where things are not quite going to plan on an engagement, we need to mobilise the right help and take actions to make things better.  To date, all of our engagements have had their own unique way of tackling these challenges.

As part of our drive to take a more joined-up approach to how we work and have consistency (but not conformity!) across the company, we have rolled out a **Delivery Quality** review process.  This process has been devised, validated, and refined by people from every discipline to make sure it works for all teams across the company.  The basic process which repeats every two weeks is as follows:

* Tech Leads and Delivery Leads assess the health of their engagement against a set of common criteria and record it in the **Delivery Quality** template - highlighting where they need help.  
* These assessments are then discussed by their peers and Practice Leads to examine problems and discuss potential solutions.  
* Particular areas of challenge are reviewed by Practice Leads and Directors to ensure the right support is provided to Delivery Leads, Tech Leads, and their teams.  
  
This new process has the following objectives:  

* Provide tools that help teams identify issues and foster improvement so that we can deliver great outcomes for our customers.
* Provide an effective way of calling for support and receiving constructive challenges from those outside the account.
* Make things simpler by putting the ownership of quality in the hands of the team on the account and avoiding repeated *“How’s it going?”* conversations.

The **Delivery Quality** process will be progressively rolled out across the company.  Practice Leads will be hosting a number of show and tell sessions to elaborate on the new approach and provide additional details of how it will work.  

There will undoubtedly be some teething troubles as we all get comfortable with the new approach – bear with us and don’t skip on the feedback.  We’re totally open to reshaping things to make them better.  

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback then do not hesitate to ask a Practice Lead for help.
